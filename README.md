# Mac OSX - PC Keyboard Layouts

PC-based keyboard layouts for Mac OSX with some customizations. Thanks to [Ukulele]<http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele>.


# Install

Copy to your `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder, and then activate them via `System Preferences` - `Keyboard` - `Keyboard (tab)` - `Input Sources`.


# What customizations ?

For less talk, just install, and fire up `Keyboard Viewer` from the menu bar (need to activate the viewer first it in `System Preferences` - `Keyboard` - `Keyboard (tab)` - `Show Keyboard & Character viewers...`).

For a longer read, go to <http://wiki.andreineculau.com/Custom_Keyboard_Layouts_with_Romanian_Diacritics>
(albeit that page has information about the outdated sibling keyboard layouts for PC).
