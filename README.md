# xkb-for-macos [UN DES SEUL KEY LAYOUT QUI MARCHE !!! (VALIDE on SONOMA14.04!]

PC keyboard layouts for MacOS straight from X11 xkb.

Thanks to [klfc](https://github.com/39aldo39/klfc),
we converted all keyboard layouts from an Ubuntu 20.04 distribution (X11 xkb) to MacOS (keylayout).

Outcome: type on your Mac the same way you would type on a PC.


## Installation

You can either do the following in `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` for all users (recommended)
or `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` only for your own user.

The preferred way is to clone this git repository

```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
sudo git clone https://github.com/ysoftwareab/xkb-for-macos.git /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```

but you can also copy individual `y-xkb-<language>.*` files.

You can then activate the `ysoftwareab xkb <language>`
via `System Preferences` - `Keyboard` - `Keyboard (tab)` - `Input Sources`.

**NOTE** If you are having issues activating a keyboard,
try the following and restart ([source](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/21691/31369)).

```
sudo rm /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.IntlDataCache*
sudo find /var/ -name "*IntlDataCache*" -exec rm {} \;
```


## But why?

The reasons stem from the Swedish keyboard layout on MacOS.

Basic keys for programming are a killer to reach:

* `|` is `Right Option + 7`
* `\` is `Shift + Right Option + 7`
* `{` is `Shift + Right Option + 8`
* `}` is `Shift + Right Option + 9`

Same keys on PC:

* `|` is `Right Option + <`
* `\` is `Right Option + +`
* `{` is `Right Option + 7`
* `}` is `Right Option + 0`

Similar issues surface in other languages as you can see in Related Work.

What is different from other initiatives is that this is not a manual conversion.

For a visual diff, please consult the original MacOS keyboard layout [se.pdf](se.pdf)
and the PC keyboard layout [y-xkb-se.pdf](y-xkb-se.pdf), as exported by [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).
